**Description:**

ArticleReader is a user-friendly script designed to streamline the process of extracting, analyzing, and presenting content from online articles in audio form. This script leverages several libraries and APIs to achieve its functionality. 

**Usage:**

- After running the script, ArticleReader will display the article's content as a ready to play audio file for individuals who prefer listening to content over or along with reading.

**Note:**
- Depending on the article's length, the audio conversion process may take some time.
- gTTS may limit the number of runs a person may use in a particular sitting.
